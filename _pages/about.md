I am an Undergraduate Student Majoring in Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Science at [IISER Berhampur](https://www.iiserbpr.ac.in/).  I am currently doing my Master's Thesis Research work at IIT Hyderabad with [Dr.Srijith P.K.](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home) at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Generative Models.

**Research,** I am broadly interested in **Reinforcement Learning**, particularly in developing **unsupervised and meta reinforcement learning algorithms** with strong theoretical guarantees, including **sample complexity, regret analysis and generalization bounds**. I have a deep interest in **Foundations of Reinforcement Learning**, aiming to analyze RL algorithms from a mathematical perspective to develop **provably efficient** and **computationally tractable methods**. 

**Currently,** I am working on **continual reinforcement learning algorithms** with improved regret bounds and sample complexities to enhance adaptability in non-stationary environments. I focus on bridging theoretical insights and practical algorithm design for adaptive decision-making in robotics and autonomous systems etc.

**Outside Research,** I have a particular interest in **Machine Learning Systems(MLSys)** with a focus on developing **efficient inference** methods and **distributed training** for large deep learning models. I love Open Source and I spend time actively contributing to open source projects of my own and others (some of them are mentioned on the software page)

I am on the lookout for possible research opportunities in the field of Reinforcement learning. Feel free to connect with me to discuss **potential collaborations**, **research opportunities** and **Cool Open Source Project Ideas**.
