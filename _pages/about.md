I am a Research Assistant at the [Applied Theory for Machine Learning Research (ATMLR) Lab](https://atmlr-lab.github.io/index.html), IIT Hyderabad, working under the supervision of [Dr.J Saketha Nath](https://people.iith.ac.in/saketha/).   
I completed my BS-MS Dual Degree from [IISER Berhampur](https://www.iiserbpr.ac.in/) with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science and carried out my Master’s thesis work at [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) under [Dr.Srijith P.K.](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home) on [Non-Stationary Markov Decision Processes and Continual Reinforcement Learning](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/it6oqxw2gapwsdf81ypyn/MS_Thesis_Final_Submission_Katakam_Sandesh_20062-signed.pdf?rlkey=rz7eetkbfe4qpk29bfifim8e5&st=n9cksfbn&dl=0). During my BS-MS, I was a recipient of the [Indian Academy of Sciences(IASc-INSA-NASI) Summer Research Fellowship (2023)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FCjPHI62X9LlxjAldJ7ua4wRB16U7pYD/view?usp=sharing) to work with Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar at IIT Ropar, and also worked as [Summer Undergraduate Reseaerch Fellow(2022)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8znyjtgc99tu0rwndhxvw/IITHSummerInternshipCertificate.pdf?rlkey=5rni2mkwqvhuu7u7l4xy5t5fl&st=ta5hn3ki&dl=0) at IIT Hyderabad


**Research,** I am broadly interested in **Reinforcement Learning**, particularly in developing **unsupervised and meta reinforcement learning algorithms** with strong theoretical guarantees, including **sample complexity, regret analysis and generalization bounds**. I have a deep interest in **Foundations of Reinforcement Learning**, aiming to analyze RL algorithms from a mathematical perspective to develop **provably efficient** and **computationally tractable methods**. 

**Beyond Core Research,** I have a particular interest in **Machine Learning Systems(MLSys)** with a focus on developing **efficient inference** methods and **distributed training** for large deep learning models. I love Open Source and I spend time actively contributing to open source projects of my own and others (some of them are mentioned on the software page)
  
**Outside Research,**  I enjoy playing Cricket, Travelling and exploring new cuisines, Reading(Non-Fiction!)  
  
I'm actively seeking research opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss **collaborations, research roles, or cool open-source project ideas**.
